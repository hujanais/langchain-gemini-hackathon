# THE ASVAB

Before you join the National Guard, you'll need to take a standardized test called the ASVAB—Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery.  
  
Every applicant has to take the ASVAB, so don't let it intimidate you (it's not supposed to). It's designed to help us determine your strengths, so we can find where you'll fit best and be most likely to succeed.

The test measures your knowledge in nine areas:

-   General Science - Life, earth, space and physical sciences
-   Arithmetic Reasoning - Ability to solve basic math and word problems
-   Word Knowledge - Ability to grasp the meaning of words through synonyms
-   Paragraph Comprehension - Ability to understand written material
-   Mathematics - Math concepts and applications
-   Electronics - Electrical current, circuits, devices and electronic systems
-   Auto and Shop - Car maintenance and repair, and wood and metal shop
-   Mechanical - Principles of mechanical devices, structural support, properties of materials
-   Assembling Objects - Ability to determine how an object will look when its parts are put together

The ASVAB is timed and takes about 3½ hours to complete. It's a good idea to practice in advance, to get familiar with the process and to find any areas you might need to improve before you take the real exam.  
  
Most likely, you'll take the exam at your school, at one of over 14,000 Military Entrance Testing Stations (METS), or at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) in your area. Check with your local recruiter to find METS and MEPS locations near you.
